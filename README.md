I am a 15 year old freshman that goes to Gull Lake High School. I have been coding for 5 years and always want to get better. I am fluent in a few programming languages including Java and C#. I want to get better at web development, specifically using JS frameworks. If you want to contact me, you can send me a message on github, dm me on twitter (not as active), or send me an email at landonharter@outlook.com
