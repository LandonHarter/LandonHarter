<h1 style="font-weight=bold;font-size=large;">About Me</h1>

I am a 15 year old freshman that goes to Gull Lake High School. I have been coding for 5 years and always want to get better. I currently am fluent in a few programming languages including Java and C#. I am learning web development, JS in particular, using libararies like React to build websites.

I want to create and update many projects. I already have a few projects I am working on and updating. Check out [Radium](https://github.com/LandonHarter/radium), a game engine I made with OpenGL and GLFW. It is being updated somewhat consistently.
